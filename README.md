# AI-DL-Models

This contains all the AI and ML/DL models I learnt during courses and used for other projects.

1. NMT with Attention Mechanism - This model uses traditional seq2seq model with attention mechanism for english to tamil translation. It also uses sequential models like LSTM, GRU, RNN.<br>
2. Ex-QA using BERT and HFðŸ¤— - This model uses BERT which is fine-tuned and HuggingFace Dataset for my other project FFF.<br>
3. Crop Recommendation Model - This deep learning neural network uses softmax activation to predict the best crop based on given features.
